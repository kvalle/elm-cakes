Just playing around with [Elm](http://elm-lang.org).

To run the example:

- Install Elm (assuming [cabal]() is already installed):
    ```bash
    cabal install elm
    cabal install elm-server
    ```
- Run elm-server
    ```bash
    elm-server
    ```
- And go to [http://localhost:8000/cake.elm](http://localhost:8000/cake.elm).
